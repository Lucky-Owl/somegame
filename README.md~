#somegame

should i use string or const char* for description?

rooms do not work. fuckup with templates when i use list maybe? please, try to compile room_test.cpp

is it normal, not to free memory of list in destructor?

main problem: don't know how to do 'map' for rooms properly. should it be in each door item stats or as an array of room's neighbours? what's better?
